# Jeopardy
Jeopardy game written in Java

This was made in the summer just after freshman year. It is an inefficient small program that I wrote that took 3500 lines, which could probably be cut back by a factor of ten. It was written becuase I was bored, since it was summer, and wanted to learn how to use Java's built in GUI classes. Uploading because I am in the process of uploading all of my old programs.
